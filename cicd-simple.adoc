Creating a Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab, we will learn to create a build pipeline on OpenShift. This
pipeline will be setup using Jenkins running as an application pod on
OpenShift. The pipeline running on Jenkins will trigger builds and
deployments on OpenShift.

*Prerequisites:* You need a github account if you want to make changes
and test the pipeline kick-off.

*Step 1:* Create a new project

- Click `Create Project`
- Enter with name `pipeline-UserName`. _Substitute UserName with your own user name._
- Click `Create`

*Step 2:* Deploy your CI/CD tool (Jenkins)

- Click on `Import YAML/JSON`

- Cope and paste the below pipeline file into the text box

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: myfirstpipeline
  labels:
    name: myfirstpipeline
  annotations:
    pipeline.alpha.openshift.io/uses: '[{"name": "myphp", "namespace": "", "kind": "DeploymentConfig"}]'
spec:
  triggers:
    -
      type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: secret101
    -
      type: Generic
      generic:
        secret: secret101
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    type: None
  strategy:
    type: JenkinsPipeline
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      jenkinsfile: "node() {\n}"
  output:
  resources:
  postCommit:
....

- Click `Create`

**Note:** that the build configuration uses `JenkinsPipelineStrategy`. Also
the `spec.strategy.jenkinsPipelineStrategy.jenkinsfile` is the actual
pipeline that runs. We will discuss that in the next step.

This will spin up a Jenkins pod. Give it a few minutes as it takes time
to download and deploy jenkins. You will also see the URL assigned to
your Jenkins. It would be something like
`https://jenkins-pipeline-UserName.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}`

- Wait until the pod has started completely (notice the solid blue will show on web console)

- click on that URL, you will be taken to Jenkins Console.

**Note:**
The browser may complain that the URL is insecure.

- Click on advanced and
proceed to url.

- Click `Login with OpenShift` and enter your openshift
credentials to login.

- Checked allow all `Requested permissions` (default) and click `Allow selected permissions`

Now you will be taken to Jenkins console (that is running on OpenShift).

*Step 3:* Understand the pipeline

- Using left menu on the OpenShift Web Console, select `Builds`-> `Pipelines`. You
will see that `myfirstpipeline` is created. Click on that.

- Click `Actions` --> `Edit` from the top right corner of the panel.
- Add the following to the text area:
....
node() {
stage 'build'
openshiftBuild(buildConfig: 'myphp', showBuildLogs: 'true')
stage 'deploy'
openshiftDeploy(deploymentConfig: 'myphp')
openshiftScale(deploymentConfig: 'myphp',replicaCount: '2')
}
....
- Click `Save`

Since we haven't run the pipeline yet, the `History` tab shows nothing.
If you click on the `Configuration` tab, you will see the build
configuration details.

*Note* There are webhook urls on this page. It can be used to integrate with your repository.

Review the `Jenkinsfile` on this page. +
* It has two stages `build` and `deploy` +
* In the `build` stage the `openshiftBuild` plugin is used to trigger a
build named `myphp` +
* In the `deploy` stage the `openshiftDeploy` plugin invokes a
deployment configuration `myphp` and then invokes `openshiftScale`
plugin to scale up the same deployment configuration to 2 replicas.

This means that we need a build configuration and deployment
configuration for our application, but we want these triggered by our
pipeline (not auto-triggered by default). So let us create an
application `myphp` with the build configuration and deployment
configuration so that we can trigger it using this Jenkins pipeline.

*Step 4:* Create an application

- Click on `Add to Project` on top right corner and select `Browse Catalog`
- Enter `PHP` in the search
- Click PHP --> `Next`
- Enter `myphp` as Application Name.
- Enter `https://github.com/piggyvenus/simplephp.git` as Git Repository.
(Use your own github url if you want to test by pushing changes to code.)

*Note* When using `myphp` as the application name, same name will be
used for buildConfig and deployConfig by default.

- Now click on the link `advanced options`. It will open up a bunch of
options and we will edit those. Under the section `Build Configuration`,
*uncheck* all the three check boxes for the following options:
`Configure a webhook build trigger`, `Automatically build a new image when the builder image changes`, and `Launch the first build when the build
configuration is created`

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the builds as we want
to control those using pipeline.

In the section `Deployment Configuration`, *uncheck* the two auto-deploy
options: `New image is available` and `Deployment configuration changes`

By unchecking these, we are disabling the start of the deployments as we
want to control those using pipeline.

Now scroll down and click on the `Create` button.

This will create the required objects (build configuration, deployment
configuration, imagestream, service and route) but won't start a build.

*Step 5:* Start pipeline

- Click `Build` --> `Pipeline`
- Click on the `Start Pipeline` button to start the pipeline.

Notice the pipeline starts and `build` and `deploy` stages are executed.

- Click on the `View log` link for the pipeline. It'll take you to Jenkins
and show the logs.

- Click back to OCP web console and go to `Overview`.
You can observe the deploy, build and scale from there.

Congratulations!! In this lab, you have learnt how to set up and run
your own CI/CD pipeline on OpenShift.
